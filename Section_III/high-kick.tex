{\bfseries\color[rgb]{0.4,0.4,0.4} Part D: High-Kick Challenge}

\bigskip

The goal of the high-kick challenge is to kick the ball in the goal at maximum height. At each attempt, the team announces the minimum height their robot tries to achieve. The minimum height must be at least 1/3rd of the ball's diameter and must be a multiple of 1cm.

The ball is then placed on the penalty mark and the team may position the robot freely but at least 30cm away from the ball. After the start signal, the robot may move the ball to any position before attempting a kick from the ground. Only kicks count that score a goal of at least the minimum height. The trial ends unsuccessfully when the ball leaves
the field, or when the robot touches the goal obstacle.

The robots are ranked by the maximum height they successfully managed to kick the ball into the goal.
