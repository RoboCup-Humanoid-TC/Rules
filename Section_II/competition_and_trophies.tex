{\bfseries\color[rgb]{0.4,0.4,0.4}The Competitions and Trophies}

\bigskip

{\bfseries Setup and Inspections}

\headlinebox

The competitions in the Humanoid League are preceded by a setup and inspection period of at least 24 h. During this time, every robot will be inspected by the league organizing committee for compliance with the design rules detailed in law 4. \textcolor{magenta}{Robots need to demonstrate the ability to walk (all sub-leagues) and stand up from front and back (kid and teen size). The teams must be able to demonstrate at least one successful stand-up action from each side during the robot inspection.} All robots will be photographed during the inspection. A re-inspection becomes necessary after any change that could affect the compliance to the design rules. A re-inspection might be requested by any team leader up to 1 hour prior to a game.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Referee Duty}

\headlinebox

Each team must name at least one person who is familiar with the rules and who might be assigned for referee duties by the league organizing committee.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Competitions}

\headlinebox

The competitions consist of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Soccer games for KidSize (4 vs. 4),
\item Soccer games for TeenSize (3 vs. 3),
\item \textcolor{magenta}{Soccer games for AdultSize (1 vs. 1)},
\item \textcolor{magenta}{Drop-In games for Kid and TeenSize}
\item Technical challenges.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

In the event of less than 3 teams participating in TeenSize the TeenSize teams will join the AdultSize  \textcolor{blue}{\sout{for a joint Dribble and Kick}} competition.

\bigskip

Soccer Games are organized in one or more round robins and playoffs. For the first round robin, the teams are assigned to groups at random. All teams of a group play once against each other. The round robin games may end in a draw. In this case, both teams receive one point. Otherwise, the winning team receives three points and the not winning team receives zero points.

\bigskip

\color{magenta}{
For the AdultSize soccer games a specific rule for robot handler will apply. For every robot a game handlers are allowed to stay near the robot such that the game handler does not interfere with the game. Specifically, the robot handler:
\begin{itemize}
\item should position himself behind the robot or at a distance that allows the robot to operate freely.
\item must not block the vision of any the robots on ball or goals.
\item must not block the path of any robot.
\item must not touch any robot. Touching a robot is considered as an offense that is penalised by a removal penalty according to the laws of the game.
\item has to be dressed in black clothes.
\item may not communicate with the robot in any way, including verbally, while the robot is in play.
\end{itemize}}
\color{black}

\bigskip

After games of a round robin have been played, the teams of a group are ranked based on (in decreasing priority): 

\begin{enumerate}
\item the number of earned points,
\item the goal-difference,
\item the absolute number of goals,
\item the result of a direct match,
\item the time needed to score a penalty kick into an empty goal (up to five alternating attempts to score, until at least one team scored),
\item the drawing of a lot.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

For each game that a team has won with a difference of 10 goals only 10 goals are counted.

\bigskip

At least two teams of every group will enter the next round robin or the playoffs.

\bigskip

In the knock-out games of a tournament two further equal periods of 5 minutes each are played if the game is not decided after the regular playing time.  If during regular playing time none of the two teams in a knock-out match was able to kick the ball to reach their respective opponent's goal the extra time is skipped and the game immediately continues by the five alternating penalty kick trials. \textcolor{magenta}{If both teams agree, the regular penalty kick trials may be skipped and the extended penalty kick procedure applies instead.}

\bigskip


The game plan needs to be announced prior to the random assignment of teams to groups.


\bigskip

\textcolor{magenta}{Participation in the drop-in challenge is mandatory to advance to the quarter final. If a team advances to the quarter final without participating in the drop-in challenge it is replaced by the team that would have had the next best prospects to reach the quarter finals in direct comparison.}

\bigskip

{\bfseries Forfeits}

\headlinebox
A team that forfeits is disqualified from the competition. Forfeiting is defined as refusing to make a good faith effort to participate in a scheduled game\footnote{If robots are broken, then they should be placed on the field anyway as an indication that the team is willing to participate.}.
\begin{itemize}
\item If a team chooses to forfeit a match in the round robin games the other team plays on an empty goal.
\item If a team chooses to forfeit in a knock-out game before the quarter final, the other team continues in the competition.
\item If a team chooses to forfeit in the quarter finals, it will be replaced by the runner up team in the round robin group that included the forfeiting team.
\item If a team chooses to forfeit in the semi finals or the game for 3rd and 4th place, it will be replaced by the team that lost to the forfeiting team in the quarter finals.
\item A team forfeiting the final match should announce its decision at least 30 minutes before the start of the 3rd vs 4th final.  The league organization committee may impose a one year disqualification of the team and its members in case of avoidable delayed announcements.
\item If a team chooses to forfeit the final after the game for 3rd and 4th place began, it will be replaced by the 3rd place winner, and the 4th place winner will be 3rd place. No new 4th place will be selected.
\item If a team chooses to forfeit the final before the game for 3rd and 4th place, it will be replaced by the team that lost to the forfeiting team in the previous semi-finals. The team that lost to the forfeiting team in the previous semi-finals (i.e. the one initially being qualified for the game for 3rd and 4th place) will be replaced for the game for 3rd and 4th place by the team that lost to it in the respective quarter final.
\end{itemize}

{\bfseries Gameplay}

\headlinebox
 
{\bfseries Kick-off procedure}

\begin{itemize}
\item The referee gives the signal ``READY'' that all robots have to reach their own half of the field. \textcolor{blue}{\sout{Robots not being able to position autonomously in their own half may be placed by their respective robot handler.}}
\item \textcolor{magenta}{After a period between 15 and 30 seconds the referee gives the signal ``SET''. The referee calls robots illegally positioned to be removed with exception of the goal keeper and a striker for the team having kick-off that may be placed manually by the respective robot handler. A manually placed goal keeper has to be within the team's own goal area touching the goal line. A manually positioned striker can take any legal position within the team's own half. Removed players are placed on the touch line of the respective team's side, facing the opposite touch line, to enter the field from there upon the ``PLAY'' signal. } 
\item The opponents of the team taking the kick-off are outside the center circle until the ball is in play.
\item The ball is stationary on the center mark. 
\item The referee gives the signal ``PLAY'' or whistles.
\item The ball is in play when it is touched or 10 seconds elapsed after the signal.
\end{itemize}

Robots being able to autonomously reposition themselves can take any position on the field that is consistent with the above requirements. \textcolor{magenta}{It is not allowed to manually (re-)position an autonomously positioned robot that took a legal position, except for the goal keeper and the striker for kick-off or dropped ball, if applicable.}
 
\textcolor{magenta}{For initial kick-off (to initially start or restart after a half-time interval), robots can be placed anywhere on the touch lines or goal lines on the respective team's own side outside of the goal, facing the opposite touch line or goal line, to autonomously enter the field from there. For other kick-off situations robots need to position themselves from the the position they were when the game was stopped.}

\textcolor{magenta}{Similar to a kick-off situations one striker robot for each team may be placed manually for a dropped ball, if both teams can not position themselves automatically. The striker for dropped ball may be positioned at any legal position within the team's own half outside of the center circle.}

\bigskip

If one or both of the teams in a match have permission to use a manual startup procedure, the referee gives the two signals ``SET'' and ``PLAY'' with an interval of exactly
10 seconds. Robot players without remote start capability may be started on the field after the ``SET'' signal. They may not move before the ``PLAY'' signal was given
by the referee. Robots with autonomous positioning ability are given between 15 and 30 seconds for re-positioning after a goal has been scored by one of the teams before the ``SET'' signal for kick-off is given by the referee. All human team members must leave the field of play
immediately after the ``SET'' signal and before the ``PLAY'' signal.

A team which uses manual kick-off and not kick-off with the referee box is punished by a penalty of having to wait for 15 seconds after the signal ``PLAY'' before they are
allowed to locomote. If such a team has kick-off then at the signal ``PLAY'' the referee immediately moves the ball from the kick-off position to a position somewhere on
the center line and outside of the center circle and the ball is in play. This rule does not apply if the referee box is out of commission.

\bigskip

\color{magenta}{
{\bfseries Free-kick procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The referee blows the whistle, announces 'Free-Kick' cyan or Magenta (Blue or Red) and then  places the ball depending on the call.
\item The assistant referee who operates the game controller clicks on Free Kick Cyan/Magenta Ready. Now opponent robots must move to a position at least 50cm away from the ball. They have a maximum of 15 secs. to do this.  During the 15 seconds, robots of the team that got awarded the free kick may re-position themselves as well.
\item Any opponent robot still closer than 50cm is considered as an incapable player and must be removed from the field for 30 seconds removal penalty.
\item After 15 seconds or sooner if the referee considers the kicking team to be ready and all opponent robots are at least 50cm away, the referee blows whistle. Then the assistant referee who operates the game controller clicks on Free Kick Cyan/Magenta Set/Play. The team that was awarded the free-kick can kick now.
\item The ball is in play after it has been touched by a player or after 10 secs.
\end{enumerate}}
\color{black}

\bigskip

\color{magenta}{
{\bfseries Request for Pick-up}

A robot handler may request to pick-up a robot if and only if a robot is in a dangerous situation that is likely to lead to physical injuries. If a robot handler touches a robot without the allowance of the referee, the respective robot receives a yellow card and the robot handler an official warning. After two warnings for robot touching, the robot handler may not serve as a robot handler again for the rest of the game and needs to be replaced by a different person from the team immediately. In case of repeated violations throughout the tournament, the Technical Committee can decide to permanently disallow a certain person from serving as a robot handler for the rest of the tournament.}

\bigskip

{\bfseries Incapable Players}

Players not capable of play (e.g. players not able to walk on two legs, players not able to stand, or players with obvious malfunctions) are not permitted to participate in the game. They must be removed from the field. It is up to the referee to judge whether a player is capable of play. The referee may ask the team leader of a player suspected to be incapable of play to demonstrate playing ability at any time. A field player that is not able to get back into a stable standing or walking posture from a fall within 20 seconds will be removed from the field for 30 seconds removal penalty. \textcolor{magenta}{It has to enter the field from the team's own half of the field close to the penalty mark facing the opposite touch line, as indicated by the referee. If the ball is within a radius of 0.5 m around the goal keeper inside the goal area, the goal keeper has to show active attempts to move the ball out of this radius. If no attempt is shown for 20 seconds, the goal keeper is considered to be an inactive player and removed from the field.}

\bigskip

{\bfseries Substitutions}

Up to two players per game can be substituted by other players of the same team. The referee must be informed prior to the substitution. A substitute only enters the field after the player being replaced left the field and after receiving a signal from the referee. Any of the
other players may change places with the goalkeeper, provided that the referee is informed before the change is made and that the change is made during a stoppage of the match. Exchanging a field player with a goalie does not count as substitution. Changing places/roles between a
field player and a goalie does not count as substitution.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Temporal Absence}

Servicing robots on the playing field is not permitted. A robot may be taken out of the field for service, after receiving permission from the referee. Taking out a robot for service does not count as a substitution. A serviced robot may not come into play again before 30 seconds elapsed after it was taken out. \textcolor{magenta}{It has to enter the field from the team's own half of the field close to the penalty mark facing the opposite touch line, as indicated by the referee.}

\bigskip

{\bfseries Manual Untangle of Robots}

If entangled robots fail to untangle themselves, the referee might ask designated robot handlers of both teams to untangle the robots. Untangling must not make
significant changes to robot positions or heading directions. Untangled robots must be laid on the ground not closer than 50cm to the ball and in a way not gaining an advantage.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Attack and Defense}

Not more than one robot of each team is allowed to be in
side the goal or the goal area at any time. If more than one robot of the defending team is inside its goal or goal area for more than 10 s, this will be considered illegal defense. If more than one robot of the attacking team is inside the opponent's goal or goal area for more than 10 s, this will be considered illegal attack. The referee may delay the call of illegal defense
or illegal attack if the robots make serious attempts to leave the goal area or if they are hindered from leaving the goal area by robots of the opponent team. The referee allows play to continue when the team against
which an illegal defense or illegal attack has been committed will benefit from such an advantage and penalizes the original offence if the anticipated advantages does not ensue at that time. The player committing an illegal defense or an illegal attack will be removed from the field for 30 seconds removal penalty.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Removal Penalty}

\begin{itemize}
\item Time penalties of 30 seconds for players are called by the referee. When a penalty is called, the designated robot handler has to remove the robot as soon as possible and by that interacting as little as possible with the game. 
\item A robot suffering a penalty (except called for inactivity or service) may not be serviced. A robot suffering a penalty due to a foul or misconduct has to stay out of play for a minimum of 60 seconds if it is serviced during the penalty time.
\item The referee and assistant referees are in charge of timing the penalties and notifying the teams to put back their robots to play.
\item A field player or goal keeper suffering a time penalty will be removed from the field and is only allowed to re-enter the field from the team's own half of the field close to the penalty mark facing the opposite touch line, as indicated by the referee.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

{\bfseries Timeouts}
A team may extend a stoppage of the game by taking a timeout. During a timeout
robots may be serviced. Each team may take at most one timeout per period. If a team is not ready to resume the game when the referee wants to start the game, it has to take a timeout. If there is no timeout left, the referee will start
the game anyway. A timeout ends automatically after 120 s. A timeout also ends when the team signals its end to the referee

\bigskip

\color{magenta}{
{\bfseries Referee Timeouts}
The head referee may call a timeout at any stoppage of play if they deems it necessary. A referee timeout should only be called in dire circumstances - one example might be when the power to the wireless router is down. However, when and whether to call a referee timeout is left up to the head referee.

Referees may call multiple timeouts during a game if needed. Teams may do anything during these timeouts, but they must be ready to play 2 minutes after the referee begins a timeout. The referee should end the timeout once they believes the circumstance for which the timeout was called has been resolved. In cases where the circumstance for which the timeout was called is not resolved within 10 minutes, the Technical Committee should be consulted regarding when/if play should continue.

The team who would have kicked off if the timeout had not been called shall kickoff when the game resumes.

\bigskip

\color{magenta}{
{\bfseries Drop-In Games}

\headlinebox

{\bfseries Organisation}

Each participating team will contribute one drop-in player. Each drop-in player will compete in games with many different teams composed of randomly chosen drop-in players. In each game, the opponent will  be a similarly composed team of randomly selected drop-in players. The exact number of games played by each drop-in player depends on the number of teams that participate in the competition. A minimum of 3 drop-in games will be played by every drop-in player.

\bigskip

The Drop-in players will be allocated to teams randomly at least 24 hours before the first game takes place. The allocation to teams for the individual games is randomly chosen and changes for every single game. Drop-in players that reached the minimum number of games will not be considered for drawing unless needed to fill up a team, to have games for remaining players with less than 3 games.

If less than 6 KidSize or 4 TeenSize teams participate in the respective drop-in challenge, the challenges are merged, playing with the KidSize ball.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Rules}

All normal game rules apply to this competition. The only exceptions are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The games are played with 5 players in a KidSize team and 4 players in a TeenSize team. If there is an insufficient number of participants, games may be played 4 vs. 4 resp. 3 vs. 3 or 3 vs. 3 resp. 2 vs. 2 for KidSize resp. TeenSize.
\item Drop-in games will each consist of one 10 minute half.
\item Games may end in a draw.
\item Each of the players has a jersey number from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, resp. {1, 2, 3, 4}.
\item Drop-in teams will wear the cyan and magenta team colors.
\item One robot handler per competing robot is allowed.
\end{enumerate}

Removal of incapable players has to be enforced strictly.

\bigskip
 
{\bfseries Selection of the Referees}

Referees will be drawn from the remaining participating teams, or if needed, due to a low number of teams, the TC and OC will provide referees.

\bigskip
 
{\bfseries Scoring}

When a goal is scored, all players of the scoring team on the field receive 1 point and the player who scored the goal receives an additional 1 point. Incapable players, penalized players or players having been removed for any other reason, e.g. service will receive no point. When a goal is suffered, all players of the team suffering the goal receive -1 point, including incapable players, penalized players or players having been removed for any other reason, e.g. service will. Points from all games are summed up. Players with one more games than others only consider the points of those games with the higher scores.

Drop-in players are initially ranked according to the accumulated points. If there are ties, the tied players are ranked according to the arithmetic mean, the number of games played, the maximum points awarded in a single game and the number of goals scored. The three most highly ranked players of a sub-league receive a 'Best Player' certificate.

If the three best drop-in players can not be identified with the scheme provided above, an additional game with players drawn group wise (from the groups of equally high ranked players) from the highest-ranked players is to be played.

If there are still ties a penalty shot out among the equally high ranked drop-in players takes place

\bigskip 
 
{\bfseries Example}
 
There are 20 participating players for 4 KidSize Drop-In teams (A, B, C, D). Games shall be A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, C-D. For the first game (A-B), Player 1 is randomly drawn for Team B and plays the game with the other team members. For the second game (A-C), player 1 is not drawn. For the third game (A-D), player 1 is drawn for team A and plays the game. For the fourth game (B-C), player 1 is drawn to team C and plays the game. Now player 1 will be removed from the drawing, because the number of 3 games was reached. If there would be only 19 participants, player 1 may be drawn for the final game.

Assuming teams with player 1 to score a single goal in every game (with player 1 on the field), then player 1 will have a score of 3 and a geometric average of 1. }

\color{black}

\bigskip

{\bfseries Technical Challenges}

\headlinebox

The technical challenges consist of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Push Recovery (KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize)
\item Goal Kick from Moving Ball (KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize)
\item High Jump (KidSize and TeenSize and AdultSize)
\item High-Kick (KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize)
\end{enumerate}

For details on the technical challenges, please refer to section III of this document.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Best Humanoid Award (Louis Vuitton Cup)}

\headlinebox
 
The teams of AdultSize class and \textcolor{magenta}{the teams of Kid and TeenSize size classes that have participated in the drop-in competition} are ranked in separate lists to determine the overall best humanoid.

The ranking is based on the aggregated number of points earned in the individual competitions.

\bigskip

The points earned in the technical challenge are used directly.

\bigskip

For the soccer games the winner receives 60 points. The second best team receives 42 points. The third best team receives 30 points.

\bigskip

As KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize robots do not compete directly, a jury decides the overall best humanoid robot, 2nd best humanoid robot, 3rd best humanoid robot. The jury consists of the team leaders of all teams, except for the teams ranked first in the KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize lists. The jury decides by majority vote. In case of a draw, the president of the RoboCup federation decides the vote.

\begin{itemize}
\item The teams ranked first in the KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize lists are candidates for the best humanoid. The jury decides from the general picture of the performance according to the criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Robustness
\item Walking ability
\item Ball handling
\item Soccer skills
\end{enumerate}
for the robot that is the best humanoid.
\item Of each, KidSize, TeenSize and AdultSize, the best robot that was not chosen to be the best humanoid robot is candidate for the 2nd best humanoid robot. Criteria are the same as for the best humanoid.
\item The robot ranked first in the KidSize, TeenSize or AdultSize lists that was not chosen for 1st or 2nd best humanoid is the 3rd best humanoid robot.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

{\bfseries Trophies}

\headlinebox

A trophy is awarded to the winner of the \textcolor{magenta}{soccer tournament in each of the individual size classes} and technical challenges. In case of less than 3 teams participating in a size class no trophies will be given in this class.

\bigskip

A trophy is awarded to the teams second and third in the KidSize 4-4 soccer game, the TeenSize 3-3 soccer games and the AdultSize 1-1 soccer game. In case of less than 5 teams participating in a size class the team ranked third will be awarded a certificate instead of a trophy. In case of less than 4 teams participating in a size class the team ranked second will also be awarded a certificate instead of a trophy. The final number of trophies awarded will be decided by the RoboCup Federation based on the number of actually participating teams.

\bigskip

Certificates are awarded to the teams second and third in the technical challenges, to the teams ranked second and third in the Best Humanoid list \textcolor{magenta}{and a 'Best Player' certificate to the three most highly ranked Drop-in players.}

\bigskip

The Louis Vuitton Humanoid Cup is awarded to the team ranked first in the Best Humanoid list.

\bigskip

\textcolor{magenta}{{\bfseries Conflict Resolution}}

\headlinebox

\textcolor{magenta}{
Doubts concerning a serious violation of any rule during a specific game must be brought up to a member of the Technical Committee and investigated before signing the result sheet. By signing the result sheet, a team agrees that the result came off in a fair game. If a team brings up an official concern to the Technical Committee, a meeting of the Technical Committee must be called as soon as possible. If the team of a member of the Technical Committee is directly involved in the game in question, the respective member is excluded from the meeting. At least three members of the Technical Committee need to be part of the meeting and the decision process. If less than three members of the Technical Committee are available, members of the Organizing committee or, if necessary, Trustees or members of committees from other leagues have to be called into the meeting. Members of these meetings may request to inspect the hardware and software of any team involved in the issue. If serious violations of rules are detected, the committee may, among others, decide to invalidate the result of the game in question or take disciplinary actions against a team as defined in Law 5, depending on the severity of the rule violation. The decision of the committee meeting need to be announced to the whole league.}
