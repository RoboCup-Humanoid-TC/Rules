\bigskip

Direct and indirect free kicks and penalty kicks can only be awarded for
offences and infringements committed when the ball is in play.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Direct free kick (physical competition)}

\headlinebox

A direct free kick is awarded to the opposing team if a player commits
any of the following offences to a player of the opposing team:
\begin{itemize}
\item uses forceful contact that significantly destabilizes a player, such
    that walking and/or kicking is impeded. Examples for forceful contacts
    include falling into another player or walking carelessly into another
    player at significant speed.
\item walks into another player for 4 to 5 seconds (even a fallen or
    getting up player), even if the 'force to push' is minimal.
\end{itemize}


A free kick is not awarded if one of the following exceptions occurs: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The player committing the offence is stationary, including a player that is kicking, provided that the ball was close enough where a kick could have succeeded at the start of the kick motion.
\item The player committing the offence is currently getting up.
\item The player committing the offence is the current goal keeper and is currently \removed{looking at or} chasing the ball, in it's own penalty area.
\item Front to front contact between players with the ball between them does not lead to a free kick, unless one player walks at a significantly higher speed or with significantly more force that is impossible to stand for the other player.
\item Any player proceeding to the ball whose side (i. e. arm, shoulder etc.) who only  makes contact with another player is not committing an offence, even if the second player is not proceeding to the ball.
\item A player that had an offence committed against himself can not simultaneously be called for a free kick offence himself.
\end{itemize}


\greyed{
(replaces: A direct free kick is awarded to the opposing team if a player commits any of the following seven offences in a manner considered by the referee to be careless, reckless or using excessive force:

\begin{itemize}
\item kicks or attempts to kick an opponent
\item trips or attempts to trip an opponent
\item jumps at an opponent 
\item charges an opponent 
\item strikes or attempts to strike an opponent
\item pushes an opponent 
\item tackles an opponent) 
\end{itemize}}

\bigskip


A direct free kick is also awarded to the opposing team if a player commits
any of the following \greyed{(replaces: three) }%
offences:

\begin{itemize}
\item holds an opponent
\item spits at an opponent
\item handles the ball deliberately
    (except for the goalkeeper within his own penalty area)
\item \simplify{(new:) }holds the ball for more than \removed{1 second} \added{5 seconds} in a way that the
  ball cannot be removed from the player (a goal keeper may hold the ball up to
  6 seconds on the ground or 10 seconds lifted up with one or both hands,
    a player performing a throw-in may lift the ball up with both hands
    for up to 10 seconds). More than half of the ball's volume must be outside
  the convex hull of the player, projected to the ground, for the ball to be
  considered removable. If the ball enters the convex hull repeatedly, it must
  be removable in between for the majority of the time. If more than one player
  of a team is in the vicinity of the ball
    \footnote{defined as less than \removed{0.75m} \added{0.375m} in KidSize and \removed{1.5m} \added{0.75} in AdultSize.}
  , the convex hull is taken around all
  the player of a team, which prevent removal of the ball.
  Ball holding offences always occurs at the location of the ball.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\simplify{(new:) }If an offense did not happen within a radius of approx. 1 m
around the current ball position, or if the ball is not in play,
the direct free kick is replaced by a removal penalty.
Ball holding leads to a free kick independently of the distance between
  the robots and the ball.

\bigskip

A removal penalty is also applied to any player touching the ball with
  part of its arm, except for the goalkeeper in its own penalty area or a player
  performing a throw-in.


\bigskip


A direct free kick is taken from the place where the offence occurred (see Law 13 -- Position of free kick).
(new:) In the physical competition, if moving the ball to the place where the offence occurred would be to the disadvantage of the team to which the free kick is awarded, the referee allows play to continue.

{\bfseries Disciplinary sanctions}

\headlinebox

The yellow card is used to communicate that a player, substitute or substituted player has been cautioned.

In the virtual competition, the Technical Committee may use yellow cards to communicate that a team has been cautioned.

\bigskip

The red card is used to communicate that a player, substitute or substituted player has been sent off.

In the virtual competition, the Technical Committee may use red cards to communicate that a team has been excluded from the tournament.

\bigskip

Only a player, substitute or substituted player and in case of a virtual tournament a team may be shown the red or yellow card.

or the game is started until the game was declared finished by the autonomous referee (in the virtual competition).

\bigskip

A player who or a team that commits a cautionable or sending-off offence, either on or off the field of play, whether directed towards an opponent, a team-mate, the referee, an assistant referee or any other person, is disciplined according to the nature of the offence committed.
