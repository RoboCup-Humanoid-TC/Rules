\bigskip

A throw-in is a method of restarting play.

\bigskip

A throw-in is awarded to the opponents of the player who last touched the ball when the whole of the ball crosses the touch line, either on the ground or in the air.


\bigskip

A goal cannot be scored directly from a throw-in:
\begin{itemize}
\item if the ball enters the opponents' goal - a goal kick is awarded
\item if the ball enters the thrower's goal - a corner kick is awarded
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

{\bfseries Procedure }

\headlinebox 

If the ball leaves the field it will be replaced on the field by the referee or
an assistant referee.
If the whole of the ball passes over a touch line the ball is placed on the
touch line directly at the point at which the ball left the field.

\bigskip

Balls are deemed to be out based on the team that last touched the ball,
irrespective of who actually kicked the ball.

\bigskip

After placing the ball, the same procedure and rules of executing a indirect free kick apply.
Robots are also allowed to perform the throw-in with their hands, in this case:
\greyed{(replaces: At the moment of delivering the ball, the thrower:)}

\begin{itemize}
\item faces the field of play (in the physical competition only)
\item has part of each foot either on the touch line or on the ground outside
      the touch line
\item holds the ball with both hands in the physical competition and at least one hand in the virtual competition
\item delivers the ball from behind and over his head (in the physical competition only)

\greyed{\item (suspended: delivers the ball from the point where it left the field of play)}
\item releases the ball within 10 seconds
\end{itemize}

If a robot tries to perform a throw-in with hands and fails to respect the
rules, a free-kick is awarded to the opponent team.

\bigskip

\greyed{
(suspended: All opponents must stand no less than 2 m (2 yds) from the point at
which the throw-in is taken.

\bigskip

The ball is in play when it enters the field of play.

\bigskip

After delivering the ball, the thrower must
not touch the ball again until it has touched another player.)}
