{\bfseries Procedure}

\headlinebox

\begin{itemize}
\item After the players have taken positions in accordance with this Law, the
referee signals for the penalty kick to be taken
\item The player taking the penalty kick must kick the ball forward
\item He must not play the ball again until it has touched another player
\item The ball is in play when it is kicked and moves forward
\end{itemize}

When a penalty kick is taken during the normal course of play, or time
has been extended at half-time or full time to allow a penalty kick to
be taken or retaken, a goal is awarded if, before passing between the
goalposts and under the crossbar:

\begin{itemize}
\item the ball touches either or both of the goalposts and/or the crossbar
and/or the goalkeeper 
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

The referee decides when a penalty kick has been completed.

\bigskip

{\bfseries Infringements and sanctions }

\headlinebox

If the referee gives the signal for a penalty kick to be taken and,
before the ball is in play, one of the following occurs:

the player taking the penalty kick infringes the Laws of the Game:

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee allows the kick to be taken
\item if the ball enters the goal, the kick is retaken
\item if the ball does not enter the goal, the referee stops play and the
match is restarted with an indirect free kick to the defending team
from the place where the infringement occurred
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

the goalkeeper infringes the Laws of the Game:

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee allows the kick to be taken 
\item if the ball enters the goal, a goal is awarded 
\item if the ball does not enter the goal, the kick is retaken 
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

a team-mate of the player taking the kick infringes the Laws of the
Game: 

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee allows the kick to be taken 
\item if the ball enters the goal, the kick is retaken 
\item if the ball does not enter the goal, the referee stops play and the
match is restarted with an indirect free kick to the defending team
from the place where the infringement occurred 
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

a team-mate of the goalkeeper infringes the Laws of the Game: 

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee allows the kick to be taken 
\item if the ball enters the goal, a goal is awarded 
\item if the ball does not enter the goal, the kick is retaken 
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

a player of both the defending team and the attacking team infringe the
Laws of the Game:

\begin{itemize}
\item the kick is retaken
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

If, after the penalty kick has been taken:

the kicker touches the ball again (except with his hands) before it has
touched another player:

\begin{itemize}
\item an indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team, the kick to be
taken from the place where the infringement occurred (see Law 13 --
Position of Free Kick)
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

the kicker deliberately handles the ball before it has touched another
player:

\begin{itemize}
\item a direct free kick is awarded to the opposing team, to be taken from the
place where the infringement occurred (see Law 13 -- Position of free
kick)
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

the ball is touched by an outside agent as it moves forward:

\begin{itemize}
\item the kick is retaken
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

the ball rebounds into the field of play from the goalkeeper, the
crossbar or the goalposts and is then touched by an outside agent:

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee stops play
\item play is restarted with a dropped ball at the place where it touched the
outside agent, unless it touched the outside agent inside the goal area,
in which case the referee drops the ball on the goal area line parallel
to the goal line at the point nearest to where the ball was located
when play was stopped
\end{itemize}
