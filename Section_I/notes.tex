{\color[rgb]{0.4,0.4,0.4}{Modifications} }

Subject to the agreement of the member association concerned and provided the principles of these Laws are maintained, the Laws may be modified in their application for regional matches.

Any or all of the following modifications are permissible: 

\begin{itemize}
\item size of the field of play
\item size, weight and material of the ball
\item width between the goalposts and height of the crossbar from the ground
\item duration of the periods of play
\item substitutions
\end{itemize}

{\color[rgb]{0.4,0.4,0.4}{Male and Female}}

References in respect of referees, assistant referees and officials have been changed from the original FIFA document to a gender neutral language. The reference to players, since they refer to robots in this context, have been kept in the male gender. However, we strongly encourage the FIFA to officially change their laws of the game to fully gender neutral language in the future in respect to all participants in the game.

\greyed{(replaces: References to the male gender in the Laws of the Game in respect of referees, assistant referees, players and officials are for simplification and apply to both men and women.)}
