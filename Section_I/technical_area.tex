While the size and position of technical areas may differ between stadiums, the following notes are issued for general guidance:

\begin{itemize}
\item the technical area extends 1 m (1 yd) on either side of the designated seated area and extends forward up to a distance of 1 m (1 yd) from the touch line
\item it is recommended that markings are used to define this area
\item the number of persons permitted to occupy the technical area is defined by the competition rules
\item the occupants of the technical area are identified before the beginning of the match in accordance with the competition rules
\item only one person at a time is authorised to convey tactical instructions from the technical area
\item the coach and other officials must remain within its confines except in special circumstances, e.g. a physiotherapist or doctor entering the field of play, with the referee's permission, to assess an injured player
\item the coach and other occupants of the technical area must behave in a responsible manner
\end{itemize}
