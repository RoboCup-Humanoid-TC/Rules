of the defending team, and a goal is not scored in accordance with Law

{\bfseries Procedure}

\headlinebox

If the ball leaves the field it will be replaced on the field by the
referee or an assistant referee. There is no stoppage in play. 

If the whole of the ball passes over a goal line then the ball will be
replaced back on the field according to the following rules: 

\begin{itemize}
\item If the referee cannot determine which robot was the last to touch
the ball before it left the field, then the ball is replaced in about 1
meter distance from the corner of the field
\item If the ball was last touched by the defensive team then the ball
is replaced in a distance of a about the goal area length from the
closest corner of the field
\end{itemize}

Balls are deemed to be out based on the team that last touched the ball,
irrespective of who actually kicked the ball.
