{\bfseries Goal scored }

A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between the goalposts and under the crossbar, provided that no infringement of the Laws of the Game has been committed previously by the team scoring the goal.

{\bfseries Winning team}

The team scoring the greater number of goals during a match is the winner. If both teams score an equal number of goals, or if no goals are scored, the match is drawn.

{\bfseries Competition rules }

\headlinebox

When competition rules require there to be a winning team after a match or home-and-away tie, the only permitted procedures for determining the winning team are those approved by the International F.A. Board, namely:

\begin{itemize}
\item away goals rule
\item extra time
\item kicks from the penalty mark
\item \textcolor{magenta}{(new) extended kicks from the penalty mark}
\end{itemize}


{\bfseries Goal-line technology (GLT) }

\headlinebox

GLT systems may be used for the purpose of verifying whether a goal has been scored to support the referee{\textquoteright}s decision. The use of GLT must be stipulated in the respective competition rules.
