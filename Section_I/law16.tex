\bigskip

A goal kick is a method of restarting play.

\bigskip

A goal kick is awarded when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, either on the ground or in the air, having last touched a player of the attacking team, and a goal is not scored in accordance with Law
10.

\bigskip

A goal may be scored directly from a goal kick, but only against the opposing team.
If the ball directly enters the kicker's goal a corner kick is awarded to the
opponents if the ball left the penalty area.

\bigskip

\bigskip

{\bfseries Procedure}

\headlinebox

If the ball leaves the field it will be replaced on the field by the referee or
an assistant referee.
If the whole of the ball passes over the goal line the ball is placed on the
touch line at the intersection with the centre line on the side of the field
the ball went out.

\bigskip

Balls are deemed to be out based on the team that last touched the ball, irrespective of who actually kicked the ball. 

\bigskip

After placing the ball, the same procedure and rules of executing a direct free kick apply.
