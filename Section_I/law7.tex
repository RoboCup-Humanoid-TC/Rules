{\bfseries Periods of play }

\headlinebox

The match lasts two equal periods of 10 minutes.
Any agreement to alter the duration of the periods of play must be approved by the Technical Committee in the virtual competition or mutually agreed upon between the referee and the two teams in the physical competition, must be made before
the start of play and must comply with competition rules.
\greyed{(replaces: The match lasts two equal periods of 45 minutes, unless otherwise mutually agreed between the referee and the two teams. Any agreement to alter the duration of the periods of play (e.g. to reduce each half to 40 minutes because of
insufficient light) must be made before the start of play and must comply with competition rules.)}


  In the virtual competition, teams are given a 2 minute time period between the robot models being spawned
  and the start of the match to allow for the software of the robots to start properly.
  The start of the match is defined as the game state changing to READY for the
  first half time.
  At the beginning of the second half time, each half time in the extended
  period and the beginning of the penalty shootout,
  the autonomous referee will wait at least 15 seconds between spawning the robot models
  and transitioning to an active game state.
  Once the end of the match was declared by the referee and communicated by the
  GameController,
  teams receive a 2 minute time period to finish writing logs and properly shut
  down their program before the process will be terminated.
