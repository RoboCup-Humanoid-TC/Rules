Additional assistant referees may be appointed under the competition rules. They must be active referees of the highest category available. The competition rules must state the procedure to be followed when a referee is unable to continue, and whether:

\begin{enumerate}
\item the fourth official takes over as the referee, or
\item the senior additional assistant referee takes over as the referee, with the fourth official becoming an additional assistant referee
\end{enumerate}

Where appointed, the additional assistant referees, subject to the decision of the referee, are to indicate:

\begin{itemize}
\item when the whole of the ball leaves the field of play over the goal line
\item which team is entitled to a corner kick or goal kick 
\item when misconduct or any other incident occurs out of the view of the referee
\item when offences have been committed whenever the additional assistant referees have a better view than the referee, particularly inside the penalty area
\item whether, at penalty kicks, the goalkeeper moves off the goal line before the ball is kicked and if the ball crosses the line
\end{itemize}

{\bfseries Assistance}

\headlinebox

The additional assistant referees also help the referee to control the match in accordance with the Laws of the Game but the final decision will always be taken by the referee. In the event of undue interference or improper conduct, the referee will relieve an additional assistant
referee of their duties and make a report to the appropriate authorities.
