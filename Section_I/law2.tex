{\bfseries Decisions of the International F.A. Board}

\headlinebox

\greyed{
(suspended: Decision 1

In addition to the requirements of Law 2, acceptance of a ball for use in matches played in an official competition organised under the auspices of FIFA or the confederations is conditional upon the ball bearing one of the following: 

\begin{itemize}
\item the official ``FIFA APPROVED'' logo 
\item the official ``FIFA INSPECTED'' logo
\item the ``INTERNATIONAL MATCHBALL STANDARD'' logo
\end{itemize}

Such a logo on a ball indicates that it has been tested officially and found to be in compliance with specific technical requirements, different for each logo and additional to the minimum specifications stipulated in Law 2. The list of the additional requirements specific
to each of the respective logos must be approved by the International F.A. Board. The institutes conducting the tests are subject to the approval of FIFA.

\bigskip

Member association competitions may also require the use of balls bearing any one of these three logos.

\greyed{
(suspended: Decision 3
