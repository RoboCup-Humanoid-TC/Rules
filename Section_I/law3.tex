}

{\bfseries Substitution procedure}

\headlinebox

In all matches, the names of the substitutes must be given to the referee prior to the start of the match. Any substitute whose name is not given to the referee at this time may not take part in the match.

\bigskip

To replace a player with a substitute, the following conditions must be observed:

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee must be informed before any proposed substitution is made
\item the substitute only enters the field of play after the player being replaced has left and after receiving a signal from the referee
\item the substitute only enters the field of play at the penalty mark of the player's own half \greyed{
(replaces: the halfway line)} and during a stoppage in the match 
\item the substitution is completed when a substitute enters the field of play
\item from that moment, the substitute becomes a player and the player he has replaced becomes a substituted player 
\item the substituted player takes no further part in the match
\item all substitutes are subject to the authority and jurisdiction of the referee, whether called upon to play or not
\end{itemize}

{\bfseries Changing the goalkeeper}

\headlinebox

Any of the other players may change places with the goalkeeper, provided that:

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee is informed before the change is made
\item the change is made during a stoppage in the match
\end{itemize}

{\bfseries Infringements and sanctions}

\headlinebox

If a substitute or substituted player enters the field of play without the referee's permission:

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee stops play (although not immediately if the substitute or substituted player does not interfere with play)
\item the referee cautions him for unsporting behaviour and orders him to leave the field of play 
\item if the referee has stopped play, it is restarted with an indirect free kick for the opposing team from the position of the ball at the time of the stoppage (see Law 13 -- Position of free kick)
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

If a named substitute enters the field of play instead of a named player at the start of the match and the referee is not informed of this change:

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee allows the named substitute to continue the match 
\item no disciplinary sanction is taken against the named substitute 
\item the number of substitutions allowed by the offending team is not reduced 
\item the referee reports the incident to the appropriate authorities
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

If a player changes places with the goalkeeper without the
referee's permission before the change is made: 

\begin{itemize}
\item the referee allows play to continue
\item the referee cautions the players concerned when the ball is next out of play
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

In the event of any other infringements of this Law:

\begin{itemize}
\item the players concerned are cautioned
\item the match is restarted with an indirect free kick, to be taken by a player of the opposing team from the position of the ball at the time of the stoppage (see Law 13 -- Position of free kick)
\end{itemize}
