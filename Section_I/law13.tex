{\bfseries Types of free kick}

\headlinebox

Free kicks are either direct or indirect.

\bigskip

{\bfseries The direct free kick }

\headlinebox

Ball enters the goal:

\begin{itemize}
\item if a direct free kick is kicked directly into the
opponents{\textquoteright} goal, a goal is awarded
\item if a direct free kick is kicked directly into the team's own goal, a corner kick is awarded to the opposing team
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

{\bfseries The indirect free kick}

\headlinebox

Signal

The referee blows the whistle, announces 'Free-Kick' cyan or Magenta (Blue or Red) and then  places the ball depending on the call. The assistant referee who operates the game controller clicks on Free Kick Cyan/Magenta Ready. 

\greyed{(replaces:
The referee indicates an indirect free kick by raising his arm above his head. He maintains his arm in that position until the kick has been taken and the ball has touched another player or goes out of play.)}


\bigskip

Ball enters the goal

A goal can be scored only if the ball subsequently touches another player before it enters the goal:

\begin{itemize}
\item if an indirect free kick is kicked directly into the
opponents' goal, a goal kick is awarded
\item if an indirect free kick is kicked directly into the
team's own goal, a corner kick is awarded to the
opposing team
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

{\bfseries Procedure}

\headlinebox

For both direct and indirect free kicks, the ball must be stationary when the kick is taken 
\greyed{(suspended: and the
kicker must not touch the ball again until it has touched another player)}.

\bigskip
